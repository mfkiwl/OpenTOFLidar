# OpenTOFLidar
Open Hardware scanning laser rangefinder based on Time-of-Flight principle. No standalone laser rangefinder modules were used in this LIDAR, so its schematic and firmware are fully open.  
 
Its parameters:  
* Scanning speed: 15 scans/second
* Resolution: ~ 1% of distance, but not better than Â±2 cm
* Minimal distance: 5 cm
* Maximal distance: ~25 m (white surface)
* Angular resolution: 0.5 deg
* Measurements frequency: ~11 kHz
* Scanning angular range: ~230 deg, could be increased by changing mechanics
* Power: 0.1 A  at 5V (0.5 W). Start current could be bigger than 0.8 A.
* Size: 50x50x120 mm

Price of the components of this LIDAR is ~114$ (without delivery).  
See BOM with all calculations: "TotalBOM.xlsx".  
This LIDAR is using COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) optical components - standard lenses for surveillance cameras.
